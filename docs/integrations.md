# ü§ñ Integration

## Overview 

The following document provides a brief explanation on how the integration process came into play. It won't provide every single detail about it, but hopefully an overview to help onboarding.

Bare in mind that the integration looks into the development environment and as such will primarily discuss the local replica environment, as such, mainnet staging or any other network environments are out of scope.

Also, we'll use `Yarn` as our package manager to run our examples, but `npm run` can be used accordingly if that's your preference.

## ü§î Requirements

- The pcrgrep cli (e.g. for macOS [pcrgreg](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pcre))
- A DFX identity set to use a [Plug exported PEM](/docs/dfx.md) identity

It's recommended to check how to import the [Plug exported PEM](/docs/dfx.md) identity, it'll save you a lot of time troubleshooting, as there are known issues or bugs when attempting to import via DFX.

## ü™ö Tools

A set of tools are provided to:
- Create mock identities that you might have control e.g. via Plug
- Generate mock data
- Create certain use-cases by triggering events e.g. make an offer

We'll start by learning how to generate mock tokens on a NFT Canister.

Assuming that the local replica and the services are running let's generate some mock data (if you don't know how, check the [README](/README.md), also noted that you need to understand the basics before taking the integration path exposed here).

## ü™ô Create non-fungible tokens mock

Let's imagine a scenario in the marketplace, where you (Plug exported PEM identity imported and set as your [DFX cli](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/cli-reference.html) identity), hold a given number of non-fungible tokens ([Crowns](https://github.com/Psychedelic/crowns)) and other users Alice and Bob hold others.

Our tool, will generate the tokens based in some parameters that you'll send and distribute it among these users (You, Alice and Bob).

This is done by executing the `mock:generate-tokens` which take as first argument the `NFT Canister Id` (a DIP-721, such as [Crowns](https://github.com/Psychedelic/crowns)) and a number of tokens to generate (which will be distributed to the user or actors in the story).

üí° As noted above, you should have all the required services running

```sh
yarn mock:generate-tokens <NFT Canister Id> <Number of tokens>
```

Here's what the process does for you:
- Prepare the identities via [DFX cli](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/cli-reference.html)
- Mint DIP721 tokens for the users (yourself, Alice and Bob)
- The "number of tokens" are evenly distributed to all users

The NFT Canister Id can be found in the logs of the `services:start` command you previously run; or you can get it dynamically.

Here's an example of getting the NFT Canister Id dynamically when generating 9 tokens.

```sh
yarn mock:generate-tokens $(cd ./nft-marketplace/DIP721 && dfx canister id nft) 9
```

üí° Evently distributed means that if you pass a number of tokens that equals 9, we'd have 3 tokens assigned to you, 3 tokens to Alice and 3 tokens to Bob, because these are distributed failry among the users in the system. This is done so that you have data to reason about, you can of course change this to whatever your needs are.

## üÉè Calling marketplace endpoints

As we know the marketplace has a list of endpoints we can use to interact with, the same goes for any other services such as Crowns, or Cap. 

Some of these calls might happen at the Service level (imagine that marketplace sending data to Cap, although it seems plausible that this will change and have the data sent from the frontend instead).

But in general, you should understand that a [Candid](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/candid-guide/candid-intro.html) (Interface description language) is available, which describes the endpoints.

Here's an example of the [NFT Marketplace Candid file](https://github.com/Psychedelic/nft-marketplace/blob/develop/marketplace/marketplace.did), we've copied just the services part to keep it short:

```sh
service : (principal, principal) -> {
  acceptBuyOffer : (nat64) -> (Result);
  addCollection : (
      principal,
      nat16,
      nat64,
      text,
      principal,
      NonFungibleTokenType,
      principal,
      FungibleTokenType,
    ) -> ();
  cancelListingBySeller : (principal, text) -> (Result);
  cancelOfferByBuyer : (nat64) -> (Result);
  cancelOfferBySeller : (nat64) -> (Result);
  getBuyOffers : (nat64, nat64) -> (vec BuyOffer) query;
  getSaleOffers : () -> (
      vec record { record { principal; nat64 }; SaleOffer },
    ) query;
  listForSale : (principal, nat64, nat) -> (Result);
  directBuy : (principal, text) -> (Result);
  makeBuyOffer : (principal, nat64, nat) -> (Result_1);
  withdrawFungible : (principal, FungibleTokenType) -> (Result);
}
```

With that, we can put one of our minted tokens for sale! For this to happen we need to locate the correct endpoint and pass the arguments the function signature requests, in the correct Candid format.

Here's an example of a call without usage of wallet (as that's what our mock did) in the local network:

```sh
dfx canister --no-wallet \
  --network local \
  call $(cd ./nft-marketplace && dfx canister id marketplace) \
  listForSale "(
    principal \"$(dfx identity get-principal)\",
    (0:nat64),
    (15:nat),
  )"
```

Where `(0:nat64)` is the Token Id (0) of type (nat64), if you are curious you can find which Token ID's were assigned to your during the mock generation by looking at the logs; and where Sale price is set as `(15:nat)` where 15 the wCIP value of type (nat).

As mentioned, this applies for any other Canister, let's say check the Token Id "0" by calling the NFT Canister "ownerOfDip721":

```sh
dfx canister --no-wallet \
  --network local  \
  call <NFT Canister Id> \
  ownerOfDip721 "(0:nat64)"
```

Great! At this point you should have a basic understanding of how to interact with the available service endpoint of marketplace and in their absence, the related services such as the NFT Canister üëç
