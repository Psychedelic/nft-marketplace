# Service dependencies

The following is a brief breakdown of the utility methods to help interact with the required Services for the Marketplace Service Canister. These are created for your own convinience and while it offers a good start, it does not attempt to replace the knowledge you can get by checking the original Service documentation (e.g. if you'd like to learn more about Cap, then you're advised to check the original repository [here](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap) and so on for the remaining Services).
